#Write a function that capitalizes the first and fourth letters of a name, e.g.

#old_macdonald('macdonald') --> MacDonald

#Add your code to exercise1.py
#Note: there is a method called "capitalize." The syntax for it is 'macdonald'.capitalize() and it returns 'Macdonald'

#macintosh("macbook") --> MacBook

laptop = "macbook"
macintosh = "M" + laptop[1:3] + "B" + laptop[4:]
print(macintosh)

#I wasn't completely sure how to do this using the capitalize function, but it worked when I did it this way too. The only issue is if the word was changed, it would still print "MacBook"
