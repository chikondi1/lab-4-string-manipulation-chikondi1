#The multi-line string was scraped from the National Weather Service Website.
#Edit this exercise to produce the output below using string manipulation techniques:

#Tonight: Clear, Low: 55 F
#Thursday: Sunny then Chance Showers, High: 77 F
#Friday: Sunny, High: 73 F
#Saturday: Mostly Sunny, High: 77 F
#Sunday: Mostly Sunny, High: 71 F

#Note: Copy the below code in the edit mode to retain the multi-line string formatting. There should be 39 lines of code when pasted in Python IDLE.

# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# Keep the line above when running script
# Tells python what encoding the string is stored in
