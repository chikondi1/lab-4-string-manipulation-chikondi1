# Lab 4 â€“ String Manipulation
This script does 3 different functions. The first exercise capitalizes portions of a string, the second exercise parses and manipulates a string that has been webscraped from the National Weather Service website and the third exerecise extracts part of a url to make it more readale. [This website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56999390/how-to-extract-longitude-and-latitude-from-a-link/56999440) was useful in helping me with this lab.
