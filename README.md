# Lab 4 â€“ String Manipulation
This script does 3 different functions. The first exercise capitalizes portions of a string, the second exercise parses and manipulates a string that has been webscraped from the National Weather Service website and the third exerecise extracts part of a url to make it more readale. 

I found this lab tough, however once I realised how to start it, it was easier to figure out the next steps. For exercise 1, I was able to figure out how to run the code, however I am aware that it would not necessarily run for every word, so I'd still like to try and figure that out. For the 2nd exercise, once I got started with one line, it was easier for me to see how to do the rest, and then it became a lot easier. I thought that exercise 3 was about webscraping, but then used a website (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56999390/how-to-extract-longitude-and-latitude-from-a-link/56999440) to help me figure it out.
